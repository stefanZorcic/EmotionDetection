# EmotionDetection
A designed and created convolutional neural network that detects 8 primary emotions on human faces ["anger", "contempt", "disgust", "fear", "happiness", "neutrality", "sadness", "surprise"]

The AI was created with the Tensorflow and Keras libraries and used data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudarshanvaidya/random-images-for-face-emotion-recognition

The repositorty comes with many saved pretrained models being ['finalModel', 'm1', 'm2', 'm3', 'm4'] all of which are based are various network configurations.

If you want to test the program I recommend downloading the "emotion detection.py" script and the "finalModel" model and running it with all the python dependancies installed.
